# neilgoodman.net

This is the repository for my [wheat][] based blog. [neilgoodman.net][] currently runs a LAMP stack running WordPress, but I find it very difficult to write articles with lots of code examples in WordPress, so I am planning to migrate over to [wheat][].

# Changes to [wheat][]

[wheat][] uses [Haml][] out of the box for tempting. I do not like HAML, so I am porting the templating over to [Handlebars][].
