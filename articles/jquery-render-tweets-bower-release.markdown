A few days ago I released my first [NPM package](http://neilgoodman.net/article/connect-user-tweets-npm-release), and today I am releasing my first Bower package.

This is a jQuery plug-in that can work with [connect-user-tweets](https://github.com/posco2k8/connect-user-tweets) to display recent tweets on a blog. Both projects are currently in use on this site.

##Install

Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) and then use it to install the plug-in:

`bower install jquery-render-tweets`

##Usage

Here is a simple example to configure the renderTweets plug-in:

<jquery-render-tweets-bower-release/usage-example.js>

##Source

The source code and more documentation can be found here: [https://github.com/posco2k8/jquery-render-tweets](https://github.com/posco2k8/jquery-render-tweets).

Bugs should be reported here: [https://github.com/posco2k8/jquery-render-tweets/issues](https://github.com/posco2k8/jquery-render-tweets/issues).

These are both very simple projects. My goal with these releases was to gain experience with NPM, Bower, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and the [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) testing framework so that I can write up a few posts about them. Those will be coming soon.
