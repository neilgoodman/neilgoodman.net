February (and now March) turned out to be a big month for me.

##New Job

Last week I started a new job at [Sonic Foundry](http://sonicfoundry.com). This new position is a big departure from the work I was doing last year in a few ways. First of all Sonic Foundry currently produces a single product called Mediasite, which I now work on. This is much different than the many one-off contract projects I was doing at my last job. Secondly, I am now working completely within the realm of web applications. These applications do target mobile to an extent, but the project I work on is entirely web based with no native mobile code. The last change is that I am now developing in a Windows environment. This is more of a personal struggle for me, as I am leaving [a fuzzy-warm UX driven paradise full of Unix terminals](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) to a world where [the UI is made to look like cold cold panes of glass](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/aero).

I do plan to keep working on Android in my spare time, but now that I will be doing more web development work I will probably start to focus on that subject more on this blog. So, I want to lay out some of my ideas for future posts.

##Future Blog Plans

My current plans for this blog are to finish off the series on Android Fragments and then to move on to some posts about JavaScript. I'm currently getting back into [node.js](http://nodejs.org) for some personal projects and I'm learning more and more about advanced jQuery development on the client side. JavaScript is one of my favorite languages of all time, so I think I can come up with some interesting things to write about.

I think in the near future I might also try to tackle topics that integrate both Android and JavaScript development in what are commonly known as "hybrid apps". This is an extremely interesting topic for mobile app development and one that can get real complex real fast. If topics like "Reusing server-side JavaScript components in native Android clients" gets you excited, then stay tuned.

I'll try to keep the blog posts coming at a more frequent rate. Let me know if there are any topics you would like me to write about in the comments!
