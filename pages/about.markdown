# About

<img style="float:left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" src="/page/about/neil-goodman.jpg" /> I am a ```Lead Software Engineer``` at [healthfinch](http://healthfinch.com) and I currently live in Madison, WI. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2010 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.

My passion is software development. More specifically I work in the areas of UI, web services, and mobile. I love JavaScript, developing elegant and simple frameworks, and designing great software.

## About This Site

I taught myself how to program by reading blogs, tutorials, and online books throughout high school and college. This is my attempt to contribute back to that growing knowlege base and hopefully help other people do the same.

This blog has been built using a custom version of [Wheat](https://github.com/creationix/wheat), which runs on [Git](http://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). The source code for this site is [here](http://github.com/posco2k8/neilgoodman.net). I modified ```Wheat``` so that I could enable its rendering engine to run on my preferred front-end stack: [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). The source code for my version of ```Wheat``` is [here](https://github.com/posco2k8/wheat).

This site has been designed by my lovely and very talented girlfriend [Hannah](http://hannahfass.com).

## Interests

I'm an avid gamer and have been since I was a kid. I love all types of video games from indie games that scare the ```$%!*``` out of [you](http://www.amnesiagame.com), small studio [art](http://www.stackingvideogame.com) games, to big budget [action](http://www.mirrorsedge.com) games (ok, that one is cheating a little bit). But I really do play everything I can. My (not so) secret passion is to someday get into game development.
